# DACalc -- TODO List

## Features

- complex number support from MaPa (use complex, use real)

- possibly free variable support a'la MaPa

- possibly redo powers and roots to be more like other operators (unary root)


## Examples

- calculator:

  - optics

  - mechanics

  - electrodynamics (with CGS as well as SI systems)

  - electric circuit stuff

  - radiometry

- Python:

  - some of the same exmples as the calculator
    (use as unit tests)

  - continuum mechanics deformation

  - other examples with numpy arrays, plotting etc.

- Tests

  - Python examples (see above)

  - .da files
