# DACalc -- TODO List


### Maybe down the road:

- plots of functions


## Examples

- calculator:

  - optics

  - mechanics

  - electrodynamics (with CGS as well as SI systems)

  - electric circuit stuff

  - radiometry

- Python:

  - some of the same exmples as the calculator
    (use as unit tests)

  - continuum mechanics deformation

  - other examples with numpy arrays, plotting etc.

# Tests

  - Python examples (see above)

  - .da files
